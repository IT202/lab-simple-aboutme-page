# Lab - Simple "About Me" Page

The purpose of this lab is to practice some basic CSS as part of understanding the work that web designers do. In this lab, you'll create a simple "About Me" page that includes include some basic CSS.

The page should include your name as an H1 element; one or more pictures sized, with a border and padding; and some "top 5" list of yours (movies, food, etc.)

Use a tag/element selector to style the list items, use a class selector to style the picture(s), and use a id selector to style the h1 element.

You can add your aboutme.html file to your exising workspace in Cloud9.

When done, show your page to your neighbor.
